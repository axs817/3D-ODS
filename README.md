by Anuj Saini, anuj.saini@case.edu

This is a MATLAB script developed with version R2021b to calculate the fluorescent profiles at each layer for a ML film. The main file to run is "PhotoTherm_ML.m". You can change the parameters in the simulation settings to simulate it
for variety of different parameters
